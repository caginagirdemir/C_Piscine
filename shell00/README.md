  - Create the following files and directories. Do what's necessary so that when you use the ls -l command in your directory, the output will looks like this:

  - Once you have done that, run ```$> tar -cf exo2.tar *``` to create the file to be submitted.

- Exercise 03 - SSH Key
  - Create your own SSH key. Once it is done:
    - Add your public key to your repository, in a file name id_rsa_pub
    - Update your ssh key on the intranet. This will allow you to push the repository to our git server.

- Exercise 04 - midLS
  - In a midLS file, place the command line that will list all files and directories in your current directory (except for hidden files or any file that starts by a dot - yes, that includes double-dots), separated by a comma, by order of modification date. Make sure the directoryâ€™s names are followed by a slash character.

- Exercise 05 - GiT commit?
  - Create a shell script that displays the ids of the last 5 commits of your git respository.

- Exercise 08 - clean
  - In a file called clean place the command line that will search for all files - in the current directory as well as in its sub-directories - with a name ending by ~, or a name that start and end by #
  - The command line will show and erase all files found
  -   Only one command is allowed: no ';' or '&&' or other shenanigans

- Exercise 09 - Illusions, not tricks, Micheal...
  - Create a magic file called ft_magic that will be formatted appropriately to detect file of 42 file type, built with a "42" string at the 42nd byte.
